Welcome to Afternoon Delight, hosted by Sigma Tactical in Dallas Texas.
Trolling, racism, bigotry, etc will not be tolerated.
Squad Leaders must have a microphone, and use it to coordinate between squads.
Apologize for TeamKills in all-chat.
Multiple TeamKills will result in a permaban.
Revenge TKs are not acceptable and can result in a ban.
Squad is better with friends. If you like the way someone leads/plays, ADD THEM ON STEAM.
Sigma Tactical is always looking for new players.
Say whats up. Add us on Steam. Ask for a Discord link.
Thank your Squad Leads for doing a good job.
Mortars Dont Capture Objectives.
Silent Marksmen are the easiest to kick.
Do what your squad-lead asks you to.
